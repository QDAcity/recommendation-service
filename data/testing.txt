11: Not, its in entities, that I could, modeled yet. I have a clue about how. How can, how would I put it in a code. (in program code), so maybe you just, concept, similar concept Ive learned this thing before. So just employee or, its not quite the models Ive seen, but employees,Participant 11: its ok....some type of generalization is an example from, from object-oriented books or courses. I suppose just an entities as an actor, or its not, not a problem yet. Im able to, to define them, the next, the next, thing, relationships. So I have to work on that and try to decide where I have to apply them or how do I where? Do I find them?  
 11: Because sometimes if I try to add sub-entry... to add a sub-code, the program, doesnt make it so you have an error message. Okay. So I have some troubles on that.  
 11: Yes, I would say thats not a lot of differences between the both interviews, both of them see in personal development and HR or part of HR was very important. But the first interview. The first interview doesnt mention a survey or just this onboarding, things. Its for him its more this, personal development, career paths.  
 11: Yeah. So the interviewers, the interviewee, they jumped from one sometimes just in one answer he jumps it bit, it difficult to tag it right. 
 11: I started with the UML modeling after the second interview. Because Ive get more aware, more confident with the tasks, because of the questions and then I know the direction where it goes to from the week. So I have a good ... So the models, some feeling for model what the huge would be maybe of course.  
: And you did have some problems with the tool. Some of them were like, you had workarounds or it worked if you tried again. Thats, lets get into that a bit. So what were some of the impediments generally? So the tool and other things that you felt last week, you couldnt make any progress because of that?Participant 11: No, its just slow down a bit, workflow.Interviewer: Maybe  no progress  was in the wrong wording, but the things that slowed you down are what?Participant 11: I have to put the first interview I have just to make a new document with the first interview, because there are some probably the braces. If I delete a code the brace is still there. And yesterday the problem was the codes and the braces. If I tried to apply the code or just to correct the code. Just as example, Ive tagged two paragraphs and then I decide its just one paragraph I want to tag that gets some trouble. I couldnt delete the code in the text and just apply on the specific part.Interviewer: So make the text segment of the smaller that you tagged.Participant 11: Just other part.Interviewer: Okay. And so you did the workaround, then you found a work around for that?Participant 11: Not really. Ive just deleted the whole document and just created a new document. 
/Interviewer: Im not sure what youre exactly talking about with the scrolling synchronizationParticipant 11: If you, if you scroll just to the middle of interview and then you switch to Siemers, then its still in the middle. Sometimes its really good, but sometimes of course of the interviews, yeah.  
 I suppose, the things that are already now on the screen they will be developed too. So what about employee or company goals or personal goals? Okay. Thats a generalization. Its clear from, from my point of view. So this whole training measures or e-learning , its a generalization too.Interviewer: Yeah. Thats the generalization. I think thats pretty straight forward. Can you explain this, this relationship of personal goals as an aggregation to employees. And so employee consists of as parts of personal goals in your opinion?Participant 11: Its should be other ways. So an employee has a one or many personal goals. I suppose maybe the direction is wrong. So employee have to have, some, personal goals of course, and the personal goals would be some kind of company goals or are derived from the company goals, in some kindInterviewer: And you, you, view the personal goals as part of the employee.Participant 11: Yeah.Interviewer: Well, as opposed to here where you say the-Participant 11: Maybe the direction is also wrong. But, the training measure costs, the thing is I suppose there is no, in this model there are no training measure without, any training measure costs. So its exists as a whole.Interviewer: Okay. So that existence, thats not ... we dont really tag this, anywhere here so whether existence is mandatory on that. Well theres the difference if you, if you tag something as an association, so you could say employee has goals just as the association, and you can say employer consists of goals and all the other parts of that employee that en employee is made up of. Okay. That was an interesting design decision so thats why I was asking bout that. So was there, any change in your approach from the first week to the second? Did you change anything?  
. the difficulties how do I, how do I create an entity or just what is an entity, because, Im still in my object oriented, thinking. How do I.... So whats target agreement or its...? I suppose it would be, do you be develops or this agreement or personal development of it would be, some case or some sort of entities.Interviewer: So Im curious how you make that decision. So for instance, the new thing, target agreement that you renamed, you thought this, you didnt want to map that into the UML model, at least not yet at this stage. What is, your thinking there, that you think training measure is a concept you want to map but target agreement you dont think so.Participant 11: I have, I suppose there will be later decision that target agreement or just personal development that will be also in some, some kind of, entity or concept. Also, some, salary development or just the costs but training measure costs are already in the model.  
. You said you were more used to UML modeling directly.Participant 11: Yeah. 
^Participant 11: Yep. Okay. And I have to need to just invest more time in the model of course. 
 I found some similar concept, from the first interview. Of course. And Ive tried to tag them, or I tag them. And otherwise, there are some, concept or just, I suppose its just in the other name that like a target agreement. I have ... I had before, something like, personal goals, or manager goals or corporate goals. I suppose there are some are company goals. Change the tag to target agreement is about for me to be sounds better and but maybe in other, on other part I view, at personal goals and manager goals also.  
: Yeah. Okay. So what if you, whether you merge the two codes or leave them separate? You still want it to be traceable to where it started, right. So again, your decision to not tag the section where did that come from.Participant 11: The decision is not made yet. So, I will tag it. Maybe I will take the section of course. But I dont really know how, if it will be onboarding but yeah from now it will be tagged. Yeah.Interviewer: Just as a general advice, if you have these things that you, think about maybe tagging, I would rather tag it so you can trace it back and find it again. Otherwise, you need to search for it again. And, there are just orphans where you can find that again anymore. So you can always remove the tag later and remove the whole code. IfYou think that should, that part should be tagged then. And then again, so that decision about, of finding a consistency between the two interviews, how did that going back and forth between the interviews go?Participant 11: Its difficult to, so I have some, so the codes are there and if as I read the second interview, there are, I can cannot say exactly what Ive coded after Ive in the first interview after Ive read this, the second interview. But there are, there are some, some parts Ive, applied in the synchronization between the interviews. Yes. The scrolling synchronization, its some, sometimes its helpful. Sometimes its a bit not really helpful.  
 11: Im not sure if I using QDA appropriately, now. I suppose Im still in my vision of UML of objects of things I know.  
 11: Ive tried to tag the bigger parts. Okay. So not just the words. So some text parts, maybe paragraph or, few sentences.Interviewer: Was that reflected in the type of codes that you also created? Or did you just have the same codes and apply them to a larger segment.Participant 11: No, the coding, the codes are completely new. A whole variety of them.Interviewer: So they are broader then if you apply them to a larger section.Participant 11: There are also some things like employee, there is no part thats tagged with an employee because that would be just a word or because there are no paragraphs or sentence about an employee, or what is an employee. The employee is on, Just in, every section also on, but its a central, very important part, part of the model, but Im not really sure or able to tag an employee in the text.  
 so you said you found some codes that were similar to something we already have. Did you look that up in the other interview again? Or like what was the synchronization mechanism from method perspective in that you followed?Participant 11: Ive read the second interview, and they found some, places with the codes Ive already seen in the first interview. I would ... Ive met in the first interview in some other parts of ... or not in the first interview, but I cannot yet, tell you what exactly parts of that was. And then I switched forth and back and tried to, so some concepts like onboarding. It makes me to read the first interview.Participant 11: The first part about the career paths once more. And the decision had to be made about how do I apply onboarding and the simple development, just of the like, the young employees, the career path, the straight forward, and the personal development from the side of the HR, is very simple.Interviewer: So, you went back, if you had a feeling that there was already similar code, you, did you check that you look up the code and sack up the instances and the other interview, then? Like going through the coded sections or how did that work? Exactly.Participant 11: I have read the second interview, and it was just a feeling, and so if I found some, some similar concept, then I tagged them into the second, in the first interview because yesterday Ive read, the first interview again. So it was, still familiar with the content of the first interview. So it was not really, difficult to justify in parts.Interviewer: Okay. Thats interesting that its important for me to know. So in good we read the whole first interview to be able to remember what parts were in there. Then you went back and forth.Participant 11: ahh.. no, Ive tagged Yesterday, the first interview also. So, it was not really difficult. And the next thought was, the thought was if I have to ... could I use codes like a note books, just, just, just to, to not know as a code. Maybe I used to maybe in the next part will be ... Ive made my code system, but some other general main, main tag with, with a notebook.  
 11: I have to put the first interview I have just to make a new document with the first interview, because there are some probably the braces. If I delete a code the brace is still there. And yesterday the problem was the codes and the braces. If I tried to apply the code or just to correct the code. Just as example, Ive tagged two paragraphs and then I decide its just one paragraph I want to tag that gets some trouble. I couldnt delete the code in the text and just apply on the specific part.Interviewer: So make the text segment of the smaller that you tagged.Participant 11: Just other part.Interviewer: Okay. And so you did the workaround, then you found a work around for that?Participant 11: Not really. Ive just deleted the whole document and just created a new document.  
 11: Not, its in entities, that I could, modeled yet. I have a clue about how. How can, how would I put it in a code. (in program code), so maybe you just, concept, similar concept Ive learned this thing before. So just employee or, its not quite the models Ive seen, but employees,Participant 11: its ok....some type of generalization is an example from, from object-oriented books or courses. I suppose just an entities as an actor, or its not, not a problem yet. Im able to, to define them, the next, the next, thing, relationships. So I have to work on that and try to decide where I have to apply them or how do I where? Do I find them?  
: But generally you feel that both of these interviews have similar understanding of the domain and different focus but- 
 11: Ive read the interview once and then Ive started coding  
 Ive get more aware, more confident with the tasks, because of the questions and then I know the direction where it goes to from the week. So I have a good ... So the models, some feeling for model what the huge would be maybe of course.  
: Anything besides the tooling that you found difficult last week?Participant 11: Not just it. I have still no clue where I have to apply or how I have to apply this code system like actions. So its a ... part from QDA, its unclear. Its very unclear to me.Interviewer: The coding paradigm in particular. Thats these five dimensions.Participant 11: I would prefer you to have some, some examples. So I have to ... just to look at them. Maybe its better for me to understand how I apply these paradigms.  
 11: Because sometimes if I try to add sub-entry... to add a sub-code, the program, doesnt make it so you have an error message. Okay. So I have some troubles on that.  
 I suppose, the things that are already now on the screen they will be developed too. So what about employee or company goals or personal goals? Okay. Thats a generalization. Its clear from, from my point of view. So this whole training measures or e-learning , its a generalization too.Interviewer: Yeah. Thats the generalization. I think thats pretty straight forward. Can you explain this, this relationship of personal goals as an aggregation to employees. And so employee consists of as parts of personal goals in your opinion?Participant 11: Its should be other ways. So an employee has a one or many personal goals. I suppose maybe the direction is wrong. So employee have to have, some, personal goals of course, and the personal goals would be some kind of company goals or are derived from the company goals, in some kindInterviewer: And you, you, view the personal goals as part of the employee.Participant 11: Yeah.Interviewer: Well, as opposed to here where you say the-Participant 11: Maybe the direction is also wrong.

Okay. That was an interesting design decision so thats why I was asking bout that. So was there, any change in your approach from the first week to the second? Did you change anything?  
... the difficulties how do I, how do I create an entity or just what is an entity, because, Im still in my object oriented, thinking.  
 11: Sometimes its difficult because I, youre talking last time, I have ... its better to have a bigger part and sometimes its really difficult because the employee, its an entity and, its just a word, but it means much more than just the word. And, I feel like I feel really uncomfortable with a big part. I tried to make the parts of the coding bigger, but its still uncomfortable for me.  
 11: Then I switched to the UML editor and after, and then Ive tried to apply an UML scheme, or UML model on the parts already done. I suppose that really matters, and Ive discovered the entities Ive put on the UML models and then concepts.  
 11: Ive tried to tag the bigger parts. Okay. So not just the words. So some text parts, maybe paragraph or, few sentences.Interviewer: Was that reflected in the type of codes that you also created? Or did you just have the same codes and apply them to a larger segment.Participant 11: No, the coding, the codes are completely new. A whole variety of them.Interviewer: So they are broader then if you apply them to a larger section.Participant 11: There are also some things like employee, there is no part thats tagged with an employee because that would be just a word or because there are no paragraphs or sentence about an employee, or what is an employee. The employee is on, Just in, every section also on, but its a central, very important part, part of the model, but Im not really sure or able to tag an employee in the text.Interviewer: Okay. So problem would be you could take everything because its invovled in everything, but could tag it nowhere because its not the central focus of the definition of what were talking about employee.Participant 11: Oh well it would be just too many parts and small parts or you take with employee, and I suppose it will make a mess of the whole thing.  
 11: Its maybe later, but with this coding system, its not, I dont need it yet. The next step would be, I would like to re-arrange, the codes, in some, of course to make them better to find or just to put them in the common or general, topics like a tree. That will be the next step because of the code system would grow. And to find the right code will be difficult. That was all for yesterday. Already view this small part of the coding. That was yesterday already. Sometimes, difficult or just yeah.
